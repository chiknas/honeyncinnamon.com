# Images

Put the images for your recipes and blog posts in this folder. The folder structure should match the folder structure of the recipes or posts folder respectively.

## Rules

- Always take images in landscape mode
- Compress your images to reduce image size and make the app more responsive
  - You can compress your images here [https://www.img2go.com/compress-image](https://www.img2go.com/compress-image)
  - Use compression type quality and put it all the way down to Best compression
- Put a blurred version of your image in the same folder and with the same name but with "-blurred" in the end. This will create an even smaller image that will be rendered in case the network needs some time to load the main image.
  - You can blur your image here [https://pinetools.com/blur-image](https://pinetools.com/blur-image)
  - Stack Blur with maxed out radius
- Have fun!
